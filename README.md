University project
This is a 2D arcade shooter game, which action takes place in space. You will face the difficulty of surviving against tons of enemies, meteorites and last but not least - boss, as known as Galaxy Goliath. But don't worry, you have something that can repel the enemies as well - buffs and abilities. Choose 1 from 4 different supers for your ship and annihilate the enemies by groups at once, and after that, don't forget to take their modules (buffs), that will give you more chances to outstand the pressure.

SO, in this game, there are:
Enemies:
    HS16 - usual shuttle that has great accuracy and shot speed, but shots only once per time.
    SK09 - shuttle that will try to kill you by killing himself as well. His only purpose - to crash into your shuttle and his speed with more hp will help him to do it.
    MYXA94 - slow, inaccurate, fragile but deadly. This shuttle shots 3 bullets at time in different direction, so avoiding his attack will be a challange.
    LS500 - if you see him - you have to kill him, because if you are not, than this shuttle will show you what is the laser is. Accurate firing the beam of light, which     one shot player. So the main thing that he trying to achieve - shoot, and his amount of hp will help him to do it.
Bosses:
    Galaxy Goliath - there is a legend, anybody who will hear one beautiful melody in blank space will be dead. But nobody knows, what is that melody is, becasue when       you hear it, that will mean only one thing - you are his target. Try to repel him with your arsenal, but he will definetly shows his one to you. So there is a 4         attacks: 1) Firing from all side weapons that he has, if you are not is safe zone, there will be no mercy. 2) Weapon that will shot right in your direction with high     speed of bullets, so always be aware. 3) Spawnr weapon that will summon some SK09 shuttles, that won't give you an opportunity to relax. 4) Deadly, bright, huge         laser beam that annihilates everything infront of him. If this thing will hit you, there is no chance to stay alive.
    To destroy Goliath you have to break down all 6 side weapons, after which an engine will apears. And if you will be strong enough to destroy engine, my                   congratulations, you survived, and stopped this legend.
Abiblities:
    Strong Bullet - simple but not bad bullet with low speed and high damage and hitbox, which can destroy multiple objects.
    Laser - mini version of goliath laser, same as LS500 has.
    Teleport - by presing button once, you will leave an bullet that will stay in one position until you press button once more. In that case you will teleport on           position of this bullet, but bullet will destroy;
    Time stop - just freezes all objects except you for 5 seconds. Simple but effective.
Buffs: shield - absorbs any damage, except lasers once. Max 5 charges. Triple shot - you shot 3 times at once, but reduces your shot speed twice. Power up - your shuttle deals more damage. Triple shot and Power up have durations 10 seconds. All of them are working together - you can have 5 shields with triple shot with damage up.
